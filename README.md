# cursor
A custom cursor library

Automatically turns on with gui.EnableScreenClicker(true) or with cursor.enable(true).

Creating custom cursors never been easier, you only have to do the drawing functions and then register them at the event (left/right/not pressed events)

A default custom cursor with left click function is already added, feel free to override. (found at client/cl_cursor.lua)
